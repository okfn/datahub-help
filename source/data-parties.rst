Data Parties
============

During a data party there are a variety of activities you can get involved in:

1. Register and curate existing datasets
2. Create new datasets

1. Register and curate datasets
===============================

* Add information on the DataHub with links to source data.

* Enhance existing dataset information (better description, details of license, add data links). See page describing the types of licenses in case of doubt.

  * If you are looking for things to do look for todo items: http://thedatahub.org/dataset?q=tags%3Atodo*

  * Conventions:

    * Country: use tag country.{2-digit-code} e.g. country.uk country.us country.fr etc
    * Temporal coverage: see http://wiki.ckan.org/MicroSchemas

* Make an enquiry about openness of data.If license or openness is unclear you can make an enquiry using: http://isitopendata.org/

  * Be sure to add a note about having done this to the notes of the related Dataset


2. Clean up or extract data to create a new Dataset
